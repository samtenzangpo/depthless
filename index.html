    <h1>The “Mind-Only” System as Bridge between Mind and Matter</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">A Semi-Scientific and Philosophical Defense</p>
  </header>

  <section aria-labelledby="abstract">
    <h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
    <p>
      The Buddhist “mind-only” (cittamātra) system is frequently dismissed as incompatible with Madhyamaka
      or as philosophically naïve. This paper argues that such dismissals are unwarranted. By examining the status
      of subjectivity, objectivity, and experience itself, it is shown that “mind-only” functions not as an ultimate
      metaphysical claim but as a superior conventional ontology. Properly understood, it is fully compatible with the
      Two Truths doctrine, satisfies Chandrakīrti’s criteria for conventional validity, and serves as an effective
      conceptual bridge between physical and mental phenomena, as well as between Buddhist philosophy and contemporary
      scientific research.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>1. Subjectivity, Objectivity, and the Problem of Qualia</h2>
    <p>
      The concept of qualia—irreducibly subjective experience—is difficult to reconcile with a Buddhist philosophical
      framework. Higher schools of Buddhist tradition assert that objective reality is ultimately untenable, a conclusion
      reached either through valid reasoning or via direct meditative insight.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, once the notion of objective reality is relinquished, the concept of subjective reality becomes equally
      problematic. In the absence of objectivity, the term “subjective” loses its referent. Subjectivity presupposes an
      object against which it is defined. If neither objectivity nor subjectivity can be coherently maintained, what
      remains is experience itself, irreducible to either category.
    </p>
    <p>
      This residual “experience” cannot be meaningfully classified as either subjective or objective. It is simply given.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>2. Experience Itself as an Axiom: The Justification for “Mind”</h2>
    <p>
      To label this irreducible experiential field as “mind” or “consciousness” is admittedly problematic. Such labeling
      does not explain its origin, structure, or relation to anything outside itself. It merely assigns a name to what is
      already present.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet this move is not philosophically irresponsible. On the contrary, it mirrors standard scientific practice. All
      formal systems ultimately rest upon axioms—entities or principles that are not derivable from prior premises but are
      nevertheless declared to be fundamental. The existence of experience cannot be denied; therefore, it is legitimate to
      treat it as a foundational postulate. We will call it therefore “mind”.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this context, naming this fullness of experience “mind” or “consciousness” is not a metaphysical assertion about
      ultimate reality, but a conventional designation for the total field of all knowable phenomena—which constitutes,
      upon reflection, apart from the lack of inherent existence, mind only.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>3. The Meaning and Scope of “Mind-Only”</h2>
    <p>
      It is undeniable that all possible objects of knowledge arise within this experiential field; therefore the expression
      “mind-only” is justified in a strictly conventional sense. It does not claim that mind is an ultimate substance, nor
      does it deny emptiness. Rather, it proposes a coherent conventional ontology in which all phenomena—mental and physical
      alike—are understood as manifestations within experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Importantly, this position does not contradict the Two Truths doctrine. “Mind-only” is explicitly situated within
      conventional truth, not ultimate truth. The claim is not that mind is ultimately real, but that it provides a more
      refined and internally consistent conventional framework than competing ontologies.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>4. Compatibility with Chandrakīrti’s Criteria</h2>
    <p>
      Chandrakīrti (following Nāgārjuna) outlines three criteria for valid conventional truth:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>It is well known in the conventional world</li>
      <li>It is not refuted by conventional cognition</li>
      <li>It is not refuted by ultimate cognition</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The mind-only system satisfies all three.</p>

    <h3>4.1 Not Refuted by Ultimate Cognition</h3>
    <p>
      Ultimate cognition apprehends emptiness alone; it does not engage with conventional ontologies. Since mind-only is not
      proposed as an ultimate truth, it cannot be refuted by ultimate cognition.
    </p>

    <h3>4.2 Not Refuted by Conventional Cognition</h3>
    <p>
      A valid conventional refutation of mind-only would require a standpoint outside of mind or cognition itself. Such a
      standpoint is incoherent. Any attempt at refutation necessarily occurs within cognition and thus presupposes what it
      seeks to deny. This mirrors insights formalized in Gödel’s well known incompleteness theorem: no sufficiently complex
      system can fully establish or refute itself from within.
    </p>

    <h3>4.3 Well Known in the World</h3>
    <p>
      Mind-only perspectives are deeply embedded in Buddhist theory and practice. The formless realms (ārūpyadhātu),
      formless absorptions, and yogic experiences described throughout both Hīnayāna and Mahāyāna sources all reflect
      ontologies in which experience is not grounded in material externality.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>5. Mind-Only Across Buddhist Traditions</h2>
    <p>
      Even the Theravāda Abhidhamma contains numerous elements that gesture toward a mind-only type of ontology, though these
      references are not explicitly stated and often overlooked in favor of practical meditation techniques.
    </p>
    <p>
      Historically, prominent Buddhist thinkers—including Dharmakīrti, Serlingpa, and Candragomin, among others—endorsed
      views closely aligned with mind-only. The claim that mind-only is marginal or unorthodox is therefore historically
      inaccurate.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>6. Relationship to Madhyamaka</h2>
    <p>
      It is often claimed that mind-only is incompatible with Madhyamaka. While this may hold for some unsophisticated
      interpretations, it does not apply to the system when properly understood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mind-only can function as a superior preparatory and supportive conventional framework that leads naturally to
      Madhyamaka insight. Even after insight into emptiness, mind-only may remain one’s highest conventional understanding,
      fully integrated with ultimate truth.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>7. Mind-Only as a Non-Dual Bridge</h2>
    <p>
      Properly understood, mind-only dissolves the rigid dualism between mental and physical phenomena. It treats nāma and rūpa
      not as fundamentally distinct substances but as expressions of a shared experiential basis.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this sense, mind-only is neither idealism nor materialism. It is a non-dual framework that unifies cognition and
      appearance without reifying either.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>8. Parallels with Contemporary Science</h2>
    <p>
      Modern physics—particularly quantum mechanics—has increasingly destabilized naïve notions of physical objectivity. When
      supplemented by cognitive science and phenomenology, striking parallels emerge between contemporary scientific models and
      mind-only perspectives.
    </p>
    <p>
      For readers interested in these parallels, further exploration of alternative yet scientifically valid interpretations of
      quantum mechanics is recommended.

  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      The mind-only system is unjustly underrated not because it claims too much, but because it is often misunderstood. When
      framed as a conventional, non-dual, axiomatic ontology, it is philosophically coherent, doctrinally orthodox, and
      pragmatically powerful. Far from opposing Madhyamaka, it serves as one of its most effective conceptual allies.

    <h1>Time Based Cosmology of a Depth-less Species</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">Or a Species Whose Cognition Evolved Without Spatial Interpretations — rev 2</p>
  </header>

  <section aria-labelledby="abstract">
    <h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>
    <p>
      This paper explores a speculative cognitive and cosmological framework in which an intelligent species evolves without
      depth perception or spatial interpretive priors. Instead of constructing the world through geometric extension, such a
      species organizes experience through temporal patterns, relational dynamics, and scale-sensitive differentiation.
    </p>
    <p>
      We analyze the implications of such a cognitive architecture for scientific development, metaphysical assumptions, the
      understanding of physical phenomena, and the emergence (or non-emergence) of concepts such as mass, distance, objects,
      motion, and classical space.
    </p>
    <p>
      We further compare this depth-less model with characteristics of pre-decohered quantum mechanics, arguing that the species’
      cosmology would align closely with a time-based relational ontology similar to the universal wavefunction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Critically, we argue that this alternative cognitive framework is not merely hypothetical but represents a viable
      evolutionary path that humans possess all necessary conditions to develop, either culturally or through future cognitive
      evolution. Furthermore, awareness of this alternative enables conscious toggling between spatial and depth-less modes of
      perception.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Human cognition has evolved around depth perception, spatial navigation, and interaction with a three-dimensional
      environment. This has profoundly shaped our scientific models: classical mechanics, geometry, cosmology, and even intuitive
      notions of agency are fundamentally spatial.
    </p>
    <p>
      But these commitments are not logically necessary. Visual perception itself is free to interpretation as “with depth
      component” or without depth—both are equally valid and change nothing of the retinal image itself. The depth interpretation
      is an overlay, not inherent to the sensory data.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is possible to systematically analyze a species whose perceptual and cognitive apparatus never evolved this spatial
      interpretation. Such a species would not interpret the world in terms of “near/far,” “objects occupying space,” or
      “trajectories.” Instead, they would perceive temporal succession, pattern-variation, and relational coherences.
    </p>
    <p>
      This paper describes how such a species might conceptualize the world and what kind of cosmology, physics, and scientific
      knowledge might emerge from this radically different cognitive foundation. Significantly, we argue that humans possess all
      necessary conditions to have evolved this way, or to evolve toward it culturally and cognitively in the future.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>2. The Depth-less Cognitive Architecture</h2>

    <h3>2.1 Absence of Depth Priors</h3>
    <p>
      In humans, spatial depth is not merely a perceptual feature—it is a cognitive organizing principle applied to sensory data
      that does not inherently encode depth. The two-dimensional retinal image contains patterns of variation: texture gradients,
      relative sizes, occlusions, and parallax effects over time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Humans interpret these patterns as indicating depth and distance. A depth-less species simply never develops this
      interpretive overlay. They perceive the same rich, structured patterns but organize them as relational and temporal
      characteristics rather than as spatial arrangements.
    </p>

    <h3>2.2 Temporal and Relational Primacy</h3>
    <p>
      Because there is no interpretation of depth, all organization of experience defaults to temporal and relational structure.
      The world consists of coherently evolving pattern-clusters, transitions rather than trajectories, and cycles rather than
      distances. Patterns are characterized by their temporal signatures, phase relationships, and correlations with other
      patterns.
    </p>

    <h3>2.3 All Perception as Process</h3>
    <p>
      Critically, the depth-less interpretation is all-pervasive and includes the perceiving agent. There is no experience of
      “solid objects” because everything is understood as process.
    </p>
    <p>
      What humans interpret as solid, bounded entities are, in this framework, highly stable, slowly-varying pattern-clusters with
      strong internal temporal coherence. The ideas of physical mass, spatial extension, or near and far sides of objects never
      arise.
    </p>

    <h3>2.4 Sensory Coordination Without Space</h3>
    <p>
      All sensory modalities must be conceptually coordinated to comply with and support the depth-less framework, and this is
      entirely possible because no human sense inherently encodes depth:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Touch and haptics</strong> are experienced not as contact with solid surfaces at locations, but as temporal
        patterns of pressure-variation, texture-rhythms, and resistance-dynamics. What we call shape becomes a characteristic
        temporal signature when motor-patterns are applied.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Proprioception</strong> is not “body position in space” but current state in the context of possible motor-pattern
        configurations. Movement is transition between motor-states, not displacement through space.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Sound</strong> is already largely temporal and relational in structure. Spatial localization of sound—in the absence
        of such prior intuition—would simply not be extracted. Sound remains pure temporal pattern.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Smell and taste</strong> are experienced as pure quality-patterns evolving over time, with no association to sources
        at locations.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Sensorimotor integration</strong> coordinates different pattern-types into a unified temporal model where
        correlations across modalities provide predictive power, without requiring spatial mediation.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2.5 Agency Without Geometry</h3>
    <p>
      Agency arises not from spatial orientation but from being a locus of directly modulated patterns. The agent is not a bounded
      body moving through space but a stable attractor in the stream of temporal activity—a subset of patterns that respond to
      intentions and have a distinctive self-caused character.
    </p>
    <p>
      Action is experienced as: “I modulate my motor-patterns, and certain other pattern-clusters undergo correlated
      transformations.”
    </p>
    <p>
      To briefly illustrate this it must be considered that even in our present everyday experience, what one normally considers
      “my own body”—mirrored or in its actuality—is merely a subset of patterns appearing within the visual field itself while no
      information of ownership being inherently encoded anywhere. The strongly felt sense of ownership is no more than conceptual
      overlay. However the mere conventional validity of such “ownership” is not disputed here. As such, it exists.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>3. Scientific Development Without Space</h2>

    <h3>3.1 Physics Without Solid Objects</h3>
    <p>
      Without spatial priors, the concept of solid “objects” does not arise. What humans call objects are, for this species,
      recurrent pattern-aggregates with persistence through time and characteristic modes of variation. Since everything is
      process, there are no “things” to track, only evolving dynamics.
    </p>

    <h3>3.2 No Notion of Distance or Mass</h3>
    <p>
      Since “near/far” does not exist, no quantity corresponding to distance emerges. Instead, they quantify rate of change, phase
      relations, correlation strength, and temporal lag.
    </p>
    <p>
      Similarly, mass as “quantity of matter in a bounded object” never arises. Conservation laws would concern pattern-complexity,
      information content, or relational structure rather than material substance.
    </p>

    <h3>3.3 Gravity and Force as Temporal Correlation</h3>
    <p>
      Gravity becomes a systematic pattern of correlated transitions. What we call “falling” is, in their terms, a predictable
      shift in the temporal dynamics of one pattern-cluster relative to another. Forces are not pushes or pulls through space but
      descriptions of how pattern-transformations reliably correlate.
    </p>

    <h3>3.4 Progressive Scientific Development</h3>
    <p>Their science would likely develop through:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Pattern recognition and taxonomy:</strong> cataloguing recurrent pattern-types and their temporal signatures.</li>
      <li><strong>Dynamics and correlation laws:</strong> formulating rules about which transformations are compatible, discovering
        conservation principles of relational structure.</li>
      <li><strong>Multi-scale structure:</strong> discovering that increasing temporal resolution (zooming) reveals nested patterns
        at finer scales, with high-frequency oscillatory signatures at small scales.</li>
      <li>
        Mathematics would emphasize differential equations, phase relationships, spectral analysis, and information theory, but not
        geometry or spatial coordinates.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>4. Relational Cosmology</h2>

    <h3>4.1 Time-Based Universe</h3>
    <p>
      Their cosmology is not geometric but chronological and relational. Instead of galaxies, stars, and planets, they describe
      long-period oscillatory structures, slow transformations, and resonant clusters. The universe is understood as a vast system
      of temporally evolving correlations at multiple scales.
    </p>

    <h3>4.2 Zooming Instead of Traveling</h3>
    <p>
      Exploration involves increasing the resolution of patterns rather than changing location. When they point their equivalent
      of a telescope at what we call a distant galaxy, they experience it as increasing the temporal and structural resolution of a
      particular pattern-cluster in their perceptual field, revealing finer-grained substructure with its own dynamics.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, even human telescopes phenomenologically do not transport us anywhere—they reveal more detail in patterns already
      present in our sensory field. The spatial narrative of “looking across vast distances” is interpretive.
    </p>

    <h3>4.3 No Geometric Questions (flat versus spherical Earth or otherwise)</h3>
    <p>
      Questions about the “shape” of the world, flat versus curved space, or spatial topology do not arise. Cosmological questions
      concern the global structure of temporal correlations, scales of periodicity, and emergence of stable pattern-configurations.
      For example, what we call a “sphere” would be perceived as a coherent recognisable circular pattern exhibiting periodic
      complexity.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>5. Parallels with Quantum Mechanics</h2>

    <h3>5.1 Pre-Decohered World as Depth-less Universe</h3>
    <p>
      From our perspective, the depth-less species’ worldview resembles the quantum wavefunction before decoherence: no geometric
      interpretation, no definite objects, no spatial localization, only evolving correlations and superposed amplitudes.
    </p>
    <p>
      For them, this would simply be called “the World” or “Reality” without reference to quantum mechanics, which is our
      framework for understanding the mismatch between fundamental physics and our spatial intuitions.
    </p>

    <h3>5.2 Wavefunction as Pattern Multiverse</h3>
    <p>
      The wavefunction is not a spatial wave but a high-dimensional structure encoding correlations at every scale. This mirrors
      their cosmology, where structure is relational rather than geometric, and complexity exists at all levels of temporal
      resolution.
    </p>

    <h3>5.3 Measurement as Temporal Clarification</h3>
    <p>
      Without spatial ontology, what we call wavefunction collapse is not localization in space but a transition from ambiguous
      relational patterns to clearer, more stable ones—a shift in temporal dynamics rather than spatial determination.

    <h2>6. Emergence of Selfhood Without Space</h2>

    <h3>6.1 The Agent as Temporal Coherence</h3>
    <p>
      Without confining spatial boundaries their concept of selfhood would necessarily differ from ours. “I” would not be
      perceived as a bounded entity located “here,” but as a coherent attractor in pattern-dynamics—what represents “me” is
      continuity and self-similarity of certain patterns over time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boundary between self and other becomes merely functional, not spatial: “patterns I can directly modulate” versus
      “patterns I can only observe or indirectly influence”.
    </p>

    <h3>6.2 Weaker Self-Other Distinction</h3>
    <p>
      Other agents are viewed as not spatially separated beings but parallel temporal processes. The distinction resembles
      different voices in a choir rather than separate objects in space. Communication and interaction are naturally experienced as
      resonance or phase-coupling rather than signal transmission across distance.
    </p>

    <h3>6.3 No Interior-Exterior Divide</h3>
    <p>
      Without spatial containment, there is no obvious basis for private versus public experience. Thoughts might not feel “hidden
      inside” but rather like subtle pattern-modulations that others have less direct access to. Privacy becomes resolution-limited
      observation rather than spatial inaccessibility.
    </p>

    <h3>6.4 Death as Decoherence</h3>
    <p>
      Death changes from “my body ceasing to exist in space” to “my characteristic pattern-signature decoheres, loses stability,
      dissolves back into the general dynamics”—a melody ending rather than an object being destroyed.
    </p>

    <h3>6.5 Social Organization Without Property</h3>
    <p>
      Even in human experience, property ownership is entirely conceptual and social—fences do not contain ownership, deeds do not
      encode natural properties of land.
    </p>
    <p>
      The depth-less species would see this clearly, as there is no temptation to reify property as spatial fact. They would
      recognize all such distinctions as coordination agreements about pattern-access rights and negotiated boundaries in the space
      of permitted actions.
    </p>
    <p>
      They might not develop property concepts at all, or might develop very different ones based on temporal access rights or
      contribution to pattern-maintenance.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Why Humans Did Not Evolve This Way—Yet We Could Have</h2>
    <p>
      Spatial cognition as default possibly offered evolutionary advantages for early humans: navigation, tool manipulation,
      hunting, and survival in a terrestrial environment. However, this does not mean spatial interpretation was inevitable or
      optimal in all contexts.
    </p>

    <p>Humans possess all necessary conditions to have evolved depth-less cognition:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The raw sensory data does not determine spatial interpretation—retinal images are two-dimensional, haptic sensations are
        temporal, proprioception is state-based.
      </li>
      <li>
        Depth perception is learned and fragile—individuals who gain sight after congenital blindness struggle with depth; optical
        illusions reveal depth is inferred.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meditative and contemplative traditions have long recognized that objects are processes and that spatial interpretation is
        constructed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Modern physics is already revealing the depth-less structure of fundamental reality through quantum mechanics and field
        theory.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This is not merely hypothetical. The alternative mode exists, and once one becomes aware and convinced of its validity, one
      is able to switch between spatial and depth-less modes of perception at will, using whichever is more helpful at the moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      This requires deep contemplation to understand that spatial interpretation is added rather than inherent, followed by
      conviction that the depth-less framework is genuinely valid, and then familiarization through practice in perceiving without
      spatial overlay.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>8. Future Evolution and Cultural Emergence</h2>
    <p>
      Since the door to depth-less cognition is open—or can be opened—the same realization might occur on a large scale, naturally.
    </p>
    <p>This could happen through:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Recognition spreading that spatial interpretation is optional.</li>
      <li>Practices developing that cultivate depth-less perception.</li>
      <li>Cultural frameworks emerging that normalize and systematize this view.</li>
      <li>Developmental pathways shifting in learning environments emphasizing temporal and relational organization.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Conditions favoring this shift include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Digital environments where spatial metaphors are arbitrary</li>
      <li>Technological mediation decoupling perception from embodiment</li>
      <li>Scientific understanding undermining naive spatial realism</li>
      <li>Cultural or ecological pressures favoring less object-based, boundary-based, or territory-based thinking</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This idea has not emerged from a single source but has naturally formed from a large field of contributing conditions,
      including quantum mechanics, process philosophy, neuroscience, contemplative traditions, and the emergence of AI language
      models that provide new cognitive scaffolding for exploring and articulating complex frameworks outside conventional spatial
      thinking.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>9. Discussion</h2>
    <p>
      This cognitive architecture yields a coherent experiential world and viable scientific methodology. Its cosmology is
      temporally structured, relational, and rich in complexity at all scales. The framework is not science fiction but a genuine
      alternative that humans could adopt, either individually through perceptual training or collectively through cultural
      evolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      The depth-less species does not experience an impoverished or limited world—they experience the same richness and variety of
      structure humans do, but organized through different principles. Their science would be internally consistent and predictive.
      Their technology would manipulate patterns through temporal coordination rather than spatial force.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most significantly, their worldview aligns naturally with the fundamental structure revealed by quantum mechanics,
      suggesting that space may not be fundamental but rather an evolved interpretation overlaying a deeper relational reality.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>10. Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      A species with no spatial priors would form a time-based relational science. Their worldview parallels quantum mechanics
      before classicality emerges through decoherence. This suggests that space may not be fundamental but an evolved interpretation
      of underlying temporal and relational dynamics.
    </p>
    <p>
      Humans possess all necessary conditions to perceive and organize experience in this way. The depth-less framework is not
      hypothetical but available. With awareness, contemplation, and practice, individuals can toggle between spatial and depth-less
      modes, gaining cognitive flexibility and access to alternative ways of understanding reality, selfhood, and the nature of
      existence itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The question is not whether this alternative is possible, but whether and how humanity will come to recognize and cultivate
      it.

  <h1> Parallels with Quantum Mechanics (expanded section)</h1>

  <p>
    Although the reinterpretation of decoherence as temporal simplification may appear unconventional at first glance, there are
    parallels in acknowledged contemporary quantum research: e.g. Relational Quantum Mechanics (Rovelli); Quantum Bayesianism
    (QBism); Consistent Histories (Gell-Mann &amp; Hartle); process-philosophy approaches to QM.
  </p>

  <p>However, none of the mainstream theories do <em>all</em> of the following:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Represent space as the imaginary part of time: <strong>Z = t + i t</strong></li>
    <li>Treat spatial extension as a cognitive misinterpretation of temporal patterns</li>
    <li>Reinterpret the Schrödinger equation as a description of complexified temporal flow</li>
    <li>Recast decoherence specifically as temporal simplification of a process</li>
    <li>Fully dissolve the time–space duality and place time as the sole fundamental dimension</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Thus, our model can be seen as a feasible unification of many partial insights that physicists have not combined in this way.
    The present framework extends these ideas by introducing a unified complex-temporal structure <strong>Z = t + i t</strong>, in
    which space is interpreted as an imaginary component of time.
  </p>

  <p>
    In this formulation, decoherence naturally appears as a simplification of temporal possibilities—a reduction in the number of
    viable process-trajectories—rather than a collapse to a location in space.
  </p>

  <hr />

  <section>
    <h2>Clarifying the notation Z = t + i t</h2>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>In traditional physics:</strong> three space coordinates (x, y, z) plus time t</li>
      <li><strong>In our model:</strong> real time t plus three imaginary-time axes i(t₁, t₂, t₃)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Notations used</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Z = t + i(t₁, t₂, t₃):</strong> shows three separate imaginary-time axes</li>
      <li><strong>Z = t + i t:</strong> shorthand, where “i t” collectively represents all three axes</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The imaginary unit <em>i</em> is purely a mathematical marker—there is nothing more “imaginary” about it than about
      <em>t</em> itself. Both are temporal dimensions.
    </p>
  </section>

    <h2>Introduction to the expanded technical section</h2>

    <h3>Explaining the move: Treating space as three imaginary time axes (“i t”)</h3>

    <h4>1. The basic transformation</h4>
    <p>
      In our framework, instead of the standard 4-dimensional space–time split <strong>(t, x, y, z)</strong> we propose:
    </p>
    <p><strong>Z = t + i(t₁, t₂, t₃)</strong></p>

    <p>
      So the universe is expressed not as 1 time + 3 space dimensions, but as 4 time dimensions, where three of them are imaginary
      (orthogonal to real time). We call these the <em>i-time axes</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Each spatial dimension becomes an imaginary-temporal direction, just as Wick rotation turns time into imaginary space in
      Euclidean QFT—except here the rotation is permanent, structural, conceptual, interpretive, not a calculational trick.
      Unlike Wick rotation’s temporary imaginary time, here imaginary-time axes are fundamental.
    </p>

    <p>
      What we call “objects” are resonant standing waves in this manifold—patterns that reinforce themselves through constructive
      temporal interference. Stability emerges naturally, as non-resonant patterns dissipate. This is directly analogous to
      quantization emerging from boundary conditions: only certain modes “fit” the global temporal structure, just as only certain
      wavelengths resonate in a cavity.
    </p>

    <h4>2. The rationale for this move</h4>
    <p>There are three deep reasons why this reinterpretation is not arbitrary.</p>

    <h5>(a) It dissolves the traditional space–time duality</h5>
    <p>In standard relativity:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>time is dynamical, asymmetric, ordered</li>
      <li>space is static, symmetric, extension-like</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      But the universe does not require this metaphysical split—it is a human cognitive artifact built on depth-based perception.
      If space is fundamentally a collection of time-like degrees of freedom, then:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>all physical change is temporal</li>
      <li>“space” is a pattern of temporal relations</li>
      <li>extension is the projection of deeper time dynamics</li>
      <li>geometric distance becomes a measure of phase separation in imaginary time</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>(b) It explains why the Schrödinger equation needs the imaginary unit i</h5>
    <p>
      In standard QM, <em>i</em> is often treated as “just a mathematical device” ensuring oscillatory, unitary evolution. In this
      reinterpretation, <em>i</em> is not symbolic: it is geometric. It indicates evolution along imaginary-temporal axes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, the Schrödinger equation is literally describing: “rotation of the system into imaginary time sectors.”
    </p>

    <h5>(c) It aligns with our intuitive depth-less perception model</h5>
    <p>
      Space becomes a derived illusion produced by the classical approximation that suppresses imaginary-time components (via
      decoherence). This is multi-disciplinary: it is rooted in biased cognition itself.
    </p>

    <h4>3. Why call these “i t” axes?</h4>
    <p>Because:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>They are temporal (change, succession, phase)</li>
      <li>They are the imaginary part of a complex value (orthogonal to classical time)</li>
      <li>They are perpendicular to each other just like spatial axes</li>
      <li>They generate the same metric structure as Euclidean space</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Apart from turning all of physics into a study of time dynamics, additional results include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Classicality:</strong> classical objects = patterns stable only in real time</li>
      <li><strong>Quantum behavior:</strong> quantum phases = motion along i-time axes; interference is natural and geometric</li>
      <li><strong>Decoherence:</strong> damping of imaginary-time motion; collapse is not spatial localization</li>
      <li><strong>Wave/particle duality:</strong> wave = full 4-time motion; particle = real-time projection</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>We don’t quantize the universe. The universe quantizes itself by only permitting stable attractors.</strong></p>

    <p>
      In this framework, we do not impose quantization; it emerges naturally from the dynamics. Only those temporal wave patterns
      that form stable, closed phase cycles in the imaginary-time planes can produce a measurable attractor. Patterns that do not
      “fit” coherently dissipate and never become observable outcomes.
    </p>

    <p>
      The result is that only discrete, self-consistent modes—the temporal equivalents of standing waves—survive long enough to be
      measured. These are exactly the states that appear in ordinary quantum mechanics as quantized energy levels, momenta, and
      angular momenta. Quantization is therefore not an assumption of the model but a structural consequence of temporal
      self-consistency.
    </p>

    <h2>Space and time</h2>

    <h3>Time in the i(time) framework</h3>
    <p>
      In the i(time) framework, time is not defined as the reading of a clock, nor as any periodic physical process such as atomic
      oscillations or planetary motion. Such operational definitions presuppose spatial objects, masses, and dynamical systems,
      which are emergent rather than fundamental in this model.
    </p>
    <p>
      Time is instead taken as a primitive structural feature of reality: the ordering principle by which distinctions arise and
      persist. It is not something that “flows” through objects; it is the field within which all coherent patterns unfold.
    </p>
    <p>
      Formally, time is understood as the global parameter of phase evolution of the temporal manifold. Every structure that
      appears as an “object,” “event,” or “interaction” is a stable or semi-stable pattern in this evolving phase field. To exist
      is to exhibit a coherent trajectory of phase change with respect to this fundamental ordering parameter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Real time corresponds to the monotonic, globally consistent direction of phase unfolding—the ordering that guarantees causal
      structure. The imaginary-time dimensions are complementary directions within the same temporal manifold, representing
      orthogonal modes of phase organization rather than spatial extension.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, time is neither a measurement nor a quantity, but a condition of intelligibility: the minimal structure required for
      patterns to be distinguishable, coherent, and ordered. Clocks do not define time; they merely implement repeatable phase
      processes synchronized with the deeper temporal field.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Ultra-short definition:</strong> Time is the primitive ordering parameter of reality: the global phase-unfolding structure within which all coherent patterns arise, persist, and transform.</p>

    <h3>Space in the i(time) framework</h3>
    <p>
      In the i(time) framework, space is not treated as a fundamental arena in which objects are located. What is ordinarily
      called “space” is an emergent interpretive layer arising from the organization of temporal phase structure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Space is defined here as the relational ordering of phase structures along imaginary-time directions. These imaginary-time
      axes are not additional places or dimensions of extension, but orthogonal modes of temporal organization. Apparent spatial
      separation is therefore a pattern of phase differentiation within the temporal manifold.
    </p>
    <p>
      Distance is not a measure of how far apart objects are, but a measure of how decorrelated their phase structures have become
      along the imaginary-time directions. Spatial localization is a special case of temporal organization in which phase
      relationships become highly constrained and stable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Geometry is not imposed from outside the system but emerges internally from the coherence conditions of the temporal field.
      Euclidean and relativistic geometries are effective descriptions of how phase correlations scale, deform, and persist under
      different coherence regimes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, space is not something in which things exist; it is something that appears when temporal relations stabilize into
      persistent, quasi-local phase structures—best understood as frozen temporal difference, not extended substance.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Ultra-short definition:</strong> Space is the emergent pattern of separation created by phase differentiation along imaginary-time directions; not a fundamental container but a stabilized relational structure of time itself.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>5.1 Reinterpreting Noether’s theorem</h2>
    <p>
      In conventional physics, Noether’s theorem links continuous symmetries to conserved quantities: time-translation symmetry
      yields conservation of energy; spatial-translation symmetry yields conservation of momentum; rotational symmetry yields
      conservation of angular momentum.
    </p>
    <p>
      The i(time) framework changes this picture fundamentally. Because the ontology contains no locally stored mass, no localized
      energy densities, and no intrinsic particles, the traditional conserved quantities cannot be primary.
    </p>
    <p>
      All dynamical evolution is encoded globally in the 4D temporal manifold, and what appear as “objects” are locally stable
      configurations of phase relations. Energy becomes the global rate of unfolding temporal phase. Momentum becomes a relational
      phase gradient. Angular momentum becomes the persistence of a twist-like mode within the imaginary-time planes.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Accordingly, what is conserved in this model is not values, but symmetries.</strong></p>

    <p>Noether’s theorem is reinterpreted as preservation of specific geometric–temporal invariances:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Time-translation symmetry</strong> → conservation of global temporal-phase coherence</li>
      <li><strong>Spatial-translation symmetry</strong> → conservation of relative phase gradients between regions of the manifold</li>
      <li><strong>Rotational symmetry</strong> → conservation of topological twist-patterns in the imaginary-time planes</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The traditional conserved quantities are emergent parameters describing how a stable temporal pattern participates in these
      preserved symmetries: bookkeeping labels for invariance, not physical substances transported from one place to another.
    </p>

    <p>
      This shift is not unprecedented: general relativity already treats gravitational energy as non-localizable; gauge theory
      treats charge as a global constraint; quantum theory treats momentum and angular momentum as generators of symmetry
      operations rather than tangible stored quantities.
    </p>

    <p>
      This reinterpretation does not change predictions or calculational procedures—the mathematics remains identical. What changes
      is our understanding of what the mathematics describes.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>5.2 Pre-decohered world as depth-less universe</h2>
    <p>
      From our perspective, the depth-less species’ worldview resembles the quantum wavefunction before decoherence: no geometric
      interpretation, no definite objects, no spatial localization—only evolving correlations and superposed amplitudes.
    </p>
    <p>
      For them, this would simply be called “the World” or “Reality,” without reference to quantum mechanics, which is our
      framework for understanding the mismatch between fundamental physics and our spatial intuitions.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>5.3 Wavefunction as pattern-multiverse</h2>
    <p>
      The wavefunction is not a spatial wave but a high-dimensional structure encoding correlations at every scale. This mirrors
      their cosmology, where structure is relational rather than geometric, and complexity exists at all levels of temporal
      resolution.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>5.4 Measurement as temporal clarification</h2>
    <p>
      Without spatial ontology, what we call wavefunction collapse is not localization in space but a transition from ambiguous
      relational patterns to clearer, more stable ones—a shift in temporal dynamics rather than spatial determination.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>5.5 Treating space as imaginary time axes (“i t”)</h2>
    <p>
      Conventional space is reinterpreted as three additional temporal dimensions, each multiplied by the imaginary unit <em>i</em>.
      Instead of coordinates <strong>(t, x, y, z)</strong>, the universe can be expressed as:
      <strong>T = t + i(t₁, t₂, t₃)</strong> or more simply <strong>t + i(t)</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three imaginary-time axes replace space as a fundamental category, making all change and structure inherently temporal.
      Physical evolution is motion through a complexified temporal manifold, and space emerges as the projection of imaginary-time
      components onto human perception.
    </p>
    <p>
      Space is no longer a fundamental container. It is a cognitive and mathematical abstraction emerging from deeper temporal
      dynamics. The i(time) formulation provides a unified explanation for quantum behavior, classical emergence, and the
      oscillatory role of the imaginary unit in quantum evolution.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>5.6 The imaginary unit in the Schrödinger equation</h2>
    <p>
      The standard Schrödinger equation uses the imaginary unit <em>i</em> in a specific and unusual way. In ordinary physics,
      its appearance is often treated as a mathematical device.
    </p>
    <p>
      In our framework, where space–time duality is dissolved and space is substituted as the imaginary component of time, <em>i</em>
      becomes a geometric marker of the non-real temporal directions.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Therefore:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>The wavefunction is a field evolving in complex time, not in space.</li>
      <li>Momentum is the rate of change along an imaginary temporal dimension.</li>
      <li>Spatial extension is the projection of motion in the imaginary-time directions.</li>
      <li>Energy is the generator of transformations that mix real and imaginary time.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The imaginary unit is a marker of evolution along the imaginary-time axes (what are presently called “space”). Thus, the
      Schrödinger equation describes how the wavefunction rotates through imaginary time, not through geometric space.
    </p>

    <p>
      Dissolving space–time duality does not break the Schrödinger equation; it explains it. The imaginary unit becomes a physical
      operator identifying evolution along those non-classical temporal directions perceived as spatial degrees of freedom.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>5.7 Wave/particle duality</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Wave-like behavior</strong> = smooth progression through imaginary time</li>
      <li><strong>Particle-like detection</strong> = projection back onto real time</li>
      <li><strong>Decoherence</strong> = flattening of imaginary-time components into a stable real-time attractor</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>5.8 Scale invariance and temporal unity of the universe</h2>
    <p>
      When space is reinterpreted as three imaginary-time axes, the distinction between large-scale and small-scale structures
      becomes a matter of projection and resolution, rather than a fundamental difference.
    </p>

    <h3>5.8.1 Micro and macro as the same temporal process</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        At microscopic scales, superposition, interference, and entanglement reflect fine-grained motion through the i-time axes.
      </li>
      <li>
        At macroscopic scales, galaxies, cosmic structures, and classical objects reflect coarse-grained projections of the same
        temporal dynamics.
      </li>
      <li>
        The hierarchy of scales is emergent: underlying processes are scale-invariant; differences arise from observational
        resolution.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>5.8.2 Unified quantum-classical description</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Quantum behavior</strong> = evolution across full complex-time trajectories</li>
      <li><strong>Classical behavior</strong> = projection onto real time where i-time fluctuations are suppressed</li>
      <li><strong>Decoherence</strong> stabilizes patterns at all scales by damping i-time fluctuations</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>5.8.3 Implications for cosmology and geometry</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Large-scale geometry = correlations along i-time axes projected into real time</li>
      <li>Small-scale quantum fluctuations = same structure at higher temporal resolution</li>
      <li>Distance, curvature, expansion = derived from temporal correlations, not intrinsic spatial facts</li>
      <li>Self-similarity across scales is natural</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>5.8.4 Conceptual consequences</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Wave/particle, quantum/classical, and micro/macro “dualities” are contextual projections of one manifold</li>
      <li>Classical objects are patterns stabilized along real time; quantum effects are excursions into i-time</li>
      <li>The universe becomes fully process-based and relational</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      This view unifies micro and macro physics: the same temporal dynamics underpin both quantum phenomena and cosmic structure,
      providing a coherent framework for understanding reality without invoking space as a fundamental substrate.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>5.9 The “cat”</h2>
    <h3>Schrödinger’s cat as competing temporal modes in an i(time) universe</h3>
    <p>
      In the standard spatial interpretation, the paradox arises because “alive” and “dead” are treated as coexisting spatial
      alternatives. In the i(time) framework, the paradox dissolves: “alive” and “dead” are temporal modes of a single evolving
      pattern.
    </p>
    <p>
      A living organism corresponds to a coherent, self-maintaining temporal resonance; death corresponds to a later, differently
      organized resonance. Superposition is an earlier temporally ambiguous pattern that has not yet settled into a stable
      attractor—multiple continuation routes remain open.
    </p>
    <p>
      Decoherence becomes temporal clarification. As the system couples with its surroundings, one resonance basin stabilizes. The
      “observer” is the remainder of the universal temporal field (everything “not the cat”), with boundaries declared only for
      measurement convenience.
    </p>
    <p>
      The paradox only arose because spatial intuitions were imposed on a fundamentally temporal phenomenon.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>5.10 Quantum probability in i(time)</h2>
    <h3>The unfolding of temporal openness</h3>
    <p>
      In this model each quantum system exists as a temporally unresolved dynamic pattern, with multiple potential future modes
      embedded within its resonance structure. The amplitude weights (conventionally |ψ|²) describe the relative likelihood that
      the system will settle into one temporal attractor versus another.
    </p>
    <p>
      These weights describe the structure of the process in the present moment. Probabilities are expressions of temporal
      openness. Decoherence corresponds to interaction with what is traditionally called the “environment,” through which the
      pattern stabilizes into one attractor as temporal clarification, not mysterious collapse.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>5.11 Quantum entanglement</h2>
    <h3>Multi-dimensional temporal resonance</h3>
    <p>
      In standard spatial interpretations, entanglement appears paradoxical because one measurement seems to affect another across
      distance. In the i(time) framework, entanglement is higher-dimensional temporal resonance: resonantly coupled patterns within
      one temporal manifold.
    </p>
    <p>
      What seems instantaneous in spatial projection is coordinated unfolding along shared i-time axes. No signal travels through
      space, no causality is violated; correlation is a consequence of temporal coherence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The “observer” is again the remainder of the universal temporal field outside the local pattern, with boundaries declared
      only for measurement. Measurement reveals which attractor the system is stabilizing into.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>5.12 Feynman path integrals reinterpreted</h2>
    <p>
      In standard QM, the path integral sums over all possible “paths,” each contributing a phase factor. In the i(time) framework,
      each “path” is a temporally extended phase configuration of the universal field: a temporally allowed mode, not something a
      particle “samples.”
    </p>

    <p><strong>The path integral becomes:</strong></p>
    <blockquote>
      A global sum over all allowable temporal evolutions of the process, where destructive interference removes incoherent
      temporal variations, and constructive interference identifies the stable temporal attractor.
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Classical trajectories arise as maximally self-coherent temporal modes. Superposition corresponds to multiple temporally
      permitted modes; measurement stabilizes a mode. Wick rotation is no longer conceptually required, because imaginary-time
      structure is already fundamental and interference is meaningful rather than pathological.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>5.13 Dark energy</h2>
    <h3>Dark energy as a misinterpretation of temporal phase divergence</h3>
    <p>
      Conventional cosmology attributes accelerated expansion to “dark energy,” presupposing that space is a substrate that can
      stretch. In the i(time) framework, this assumption is unnecessary: if spatial coordinates are imaginary-time directions, the
      phenomenon corresponds to differential unfolding of temporal phases across the 4D temporal manifold.
    </p>
    <p>
      The observational signature reflects phase divergence over cosmological timescales, not a force acting on an independent
      space. The need for a dark-energy substance disappears, while the same observational phenomena can be described as temporal
      phase evolution rather than spatial expansion.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>5.14 Speed of light</h2>
    <h3>The meaning of “c” in a universe made of time</h3>
    <p>
      In the i(time) framework, the constant <em>c</em> is not a speed. It is the fixed geometric ratio between two forms of
      temporal unfolding:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>real time t</strong>, the axis of causal progression</li>
      <li>
        <strong>imaginary time (i t₁, i t₂, i t₃)</strong>, whose combined magnitude is equivalent to what we normally call “space”
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Because evolution involves both modes, the ratio between them is constrained by the manifold geometry. That ratio is <em>c</em>.
      Its numerical value depends on units, but its invariance does not: nothing can “exceed” <em>c</em> because the temporal manifold
      fixes the ratio between these two modes of becoming.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, <em>c</em> is the universal scaling factor connecting real time to imaginary time—the most basic imprint of a universe
      whose entire structure is temporal.
    </p>

  <p class="note">
    <strong>Please note:</strong> Some of the definitions have been adapted to our currently discussed model in a way that keeps
    their scientific validity while suitably complementing the standard definitions. The applied changes point toward the
    dismantling of space–time duality and the process-oriented interpretation of quantum ontology.

  <p class="note">
    All divergences occur in the same direction:

      <p>
        In a time-based ontology, an attractor is not a “place” but a mode of temporal behavior toward which a system naturally
        evolves. Attractors correspond to stable identities, habits, or recurring structures in the world’s unfolding dynamics.

    <dt id="classicality">Classicality (in Quantum Mechanics)</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>
        The emergence of classical behavior (definite states, no interference) due to decoherence. The appearance of a world made
        of solid objects with definite properties.
      </p>
      <p>
        Classicality is not fundamental; it emerges when underlying quantum processes settle into stable, low-ambiguity temporal
        patterns that behave predictably. Classicality is what the world looks like after quantum correlations have simplified
        through decoherence.

    <dd>
      <p>
        The multidimensional structure formed by one real-time axis and multiple imaginary-time axes. It represents all possible
        temporal directions along which processes evolve. Physical phenomena, including quantum behavior, are trajectories or flows
        through this manifold rather than motion through space.

      <p>
        The larger system that a smaller “system” of interest is interacting with. It is the external world or surroundings that
        can cause quantum systems to lose their coherence, a process called decoherence.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our definition of environment is the same as in standard QM but viewed in the context of our definitions of the i(time)

    <dd>
      <p>
        The apparent spatial component of a process when its motion along i-time axes is interpreted as geometry. What humans
        perceive as distance or spatial separation is the projection of underlying imaginary-time evolution onto a real-time
        framework.
      </p>
    </dd>

    <dt id="i-time-axes">i-Time Axes (our own term)</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>
        The three temporal dimensions corresponding to conventional spatial directions, each multiplied by the imaginary unit
        <em>i</em>. Physical processes evolve along both real-time and i-time axes, and what humans perceive as space is the
        projection of motion along these imaginary temporal dimensions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wave-like quantum behavior corresponds to motion through i-time, while classical objects emerge from patterns stabilized
        along the real-time axis.

    </dd>

    <dt id="manifold">Manifold (in this framework)</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>
        A continuous, multidimensional structure representing all possible temporal directions of the universe. In conventional
        physics, a manifold often refers to spacetime; here, it refers to a complex temporal manifold consisting of one real-time
        axis and three i-time axes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each point in the manifold corresponds to a configuration of the system along these temporal dimensions, and evolution is
        understood as temporal motion through the manifold rather than through physical space.

    <dt id="multi-time-trajectory">Multi-Time Trajectory (our own term)</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>
        The path of a system as it evolves simultaneously along the real-time and i-time axes. Quantum superpositions and
        interference effects reflect the structure of these trajectories, while classical outcomes correspond to projections of
        multi-time trajectories onto the real-time axis.

    <dt id="quantum-decoherence">Quantum Decoherence</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>
        Loss of quantum coherence via environmental entanglement; converts quantum probabilities into classical probabilities. In
        other words: the process by which quantum processes lose their fragile, phase-dependent correlations due to interaction
        with their environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>In our depth-less framework:</strong> decoherence is the transition from flexible, ambiguous temporal relations to
        more definite, stable temporal structures. It is not a spatial phenomenon but a reduction of the wavefunction’s possible
        temporal trajectories.

      </p>
    </dd>

    <dt id="real-time-attractor">Real-Time Attractor (our own term)</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>
        A stable pattern or mode in the real-time axis toward which temporal processes naturally evolve. In this framework,
        classical objects and particle-like behavior correspond to real-time attractors, which emerge when fluctuations along
        imaginary-time axes are suppressed by decoherence or stabilization.
      </p>
    </dd>

    <dt id="temporal-clarification">Temporal Clarification (our own term)</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>
        The process by which ambiguous or superposed temporal patterns simplify into stable, low-ambiguity trajectories. This
        concept generalizes wavefunction collapse: measurement is not spatial localization but selection of a coherent temporal
        evolution within the complex temporal manifold.

    <dd>
      <p class="meta"><em>(this term is original and definition is our own)</em></p>
      <p>
        A science-based framework that describes reality not in terms of objects moving through space but as patterns,
        correlations, and processes evolving in time. Relationships and temporal signatures replace geometric extension. Space
        becomes an interpretive convenience rather than a fundamental category.
      </p>
      <p>
        No exact equivalent in standard QM. Closest is: relational interpretations of spacetime / quantum mechanics (Rovelli,
        Barbour, etc.).
      </p>
      <p>
        To fully appreciate the i(time) model it is essential that one reads and deeply contemplates our main text preceding
        section 5.

    <dt id="universal-wavefunction">Universal Wavefunction</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>
        <strong>Classic definition:</strong> The wavefunction of the entire universe (Everett / Many Worlds), defined over
        configuration space.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Time-based model:</strong> The complete description of all possible temporal processes and their correlations in
        the entire universe. It encodes every coherent pattern and every potential evolution. In this worldview, the universal
        wavefunction is not a spatial distribution but a multiscale relational field of evolving temporal structure.

    <dt id="wavefunction">Wavefunction (or wave-function, wave function)</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>
        Wavefunction, in quantum mechanics, is the variable quantity that mathematically describes the wave characteristics of a
        particle. The value of the wavefunction of a particle at a given point of space and time is related to the likelihood of
        the particle's being there at the time.

    </dd>

    <dt id="wavefunction-collapse">Wavefunction Collapse</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>
        <strong>Classic definition:</strong> Reduction of the wavefunction from superposition to a single eigenstate upon
        measurement.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>In our context:</strong> A shift from many possible temporal evolutions to one stable evolution when a system is
        measured or interacts with its environment.
        <em>See:</em> <a href="#environment">Environment</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Collapse (in the time-based model) is not about a particle “appearing at a location” but about the clarification of a
        process, where ambiguous correlations are replaced by a definite temporal pattern (an attractor).

  <section id="p6" class="page"><h1>FAQ</h1><p><article class="content faq">

  <h1>Appendix — FAQ for Skeptics of the i(Time) Framework</h1>

  <section>
    <h2>Q1 — “Isn’t this just re-labeling space as imaginary time?”</h2>
    <p><strong>Only superficially.</strong></p>
    <p>
      The model replaces the ontological distinction between space and time with a single underlying entity
      (<em>temporal phase</em>), from which spatial relations arise as imaginary-time phase displacements.
    </p>
    <p>
      This eliminates the need to separately postulate metric signatures, spatial locality, and the origin of <em>c</em>.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Q2 — “Isn’t this incompatible with quantum field theory?”</h2>
    <p><strong>No.</strong></p>
    <p>
      QFT already treats fields as oscillatory processes in spacetime.
      Replacing spacetime with a temporal manifold changes interpretation, not the local algebra.
    </p>
    <p>
      Creation and annihilation operators still arise from harmonic modes of the field,
      because the field equations retain their form under the substitution.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Q3 — “Isn't the i(time) model just another ‘classical’ interpretation?”</h2>
    <p><strong>No.</strong></p>
    <p>
      Although the i(time) framework replaces abstract Hilbert space with a geometric temporal manifold:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The evolution is unitary along real time</li>
      <li>Phase relationships between points in the manifold lead to interference</li>
      <li>Measurement corresponds to convergence into an attractor</li>
    </ul>
    <p>That means:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Probabilities are still calculated as |amplitude|², as in standard QM</li>
      <li>Superposition and interference emerge as resonances of temporal patterns</li>
      <li>Classical probability alone would never produce interference patterns</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      By giving the wavefunction a geometric substrate in the i(time) manifold,
      the framework naturally accommodates curvature and relational structure,
      providing a conceptual bridge to general relativity while preserving all quantum phenomena.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Q4 — “Does this theory help us compute anything new?”</h2>
    <p><strong>Yes — most significantly, the origin of <em>c</em>.</strong></p>
    <p>
      The speed of light arises as a fixed geometric ratio between two forms of temporal unfolding:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Real time</strong> <em>t</em> — the axis of causal progression</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Imaginary time</strong> <em>i(t₁, t₂, t₃)</em> — whose combined magnitude is traditionally called “space”
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>c</strong> is the universal scaling factor connecting real time to imaginary time.
      This explanation is impossible in standard relativity but natural here.
    </p>
    <p><em>See also: Q9</em></p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Q5 — “If everything is wave-like, why don’t we see waves in macroscopic objects?”</h2>
    <p>
      Because macroscopic objects contain ~10²⁶ degrees of freedom.
      Their collective wavefunction decoheres almost instantly, producing stable classical behavior.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is exactly what happens in standard quantum mechanics.
      The i(time) framework doesn’t remove wave behavior — it explains why classicality emerges so reliably.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Q6 — “Why can’t you compute a baseball’s trajectory directly from the wave equations?”</h2>
    <p>
      For the same reason one cannot do so in quantum field theory:
      the full wavefunction lives in an astronomically large configuration space.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is a computational barrier, not a conceptual flaw.
      Macroscopic physics is the coarse-grained limit of the deeper theory — exactly as observed.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Q7 — “Are conservation laws preserved?”</h2>
    <p><strong>Yes.</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Energy</strong> → frequency of real-time oscillation</li>
      <li><strong>Momentum</strong> → rate of phase change along imaginary-time axes</li>
      <li><strong>Angular momentum</strong> → conserved rotational symmetry in imaginary-time planes</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These arise automatically from Noether’s theorem applied to the temporal manifold’s symmetries.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Q8 — “How does the model preserve relativity?”</h2>
    <p>
      Lorentz symmetry becomes a statement about rotations between real and imaginary temporal phases.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Lorentz transformation emerges cleanly,
      with <em>c</em> as the maximum rate at which real-time evolution can coherently transfer to imaginary-time evolution.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Q9 — “What sets the numerical value of <em>c</em>?”</h2>
    <p>
      <em>c</em> is a geometric conversion ratio inherent to the temporal manifold itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      A full prediction requires linking laboratory time standards
      (atomic frequencies) to intrinsic manifold curvature.
      The framework makes this possible in principle.
    </p>
    <p><em>See also: Q4</em></p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Q10 — “Why is the universe expanding?”</h2>
    <p>
      Expansion corresponds to large-scale drift in imaginary-time axes
      of phase-coherent regions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dark energy becomes unnecessary as a pressure term,
      naturally avoiding the 120-orders-of-magnitude vacuum-energy discrepancy.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Q11 — “Does the model eliminate dark matter or dark energy?”</h2>
    <p>
      Dark energy is eliminated.
      Dark matter may be explained as large-scale phase curvature
      in the imaginary-time manifold.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Q12 — “Is the model testable?”</h2>
    <p><strong>Yes.</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Phase-curvature lensing effects</li>
      <li>Frequency-domain shifts in atomic clocks</li>
      <li>Predicted coherence limits defining <em>c</em></li>
      <li>Alternative interpretations of cosmological redshift</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Q13 — “Is this just reinterpretation?”</h2>
    <p><strong>No.</strong></p>
    <p>The i(time) model:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Removes the need for dark energy</li>
      <li>Explains the origin of <em>c</em></li>
      <li>Unifies space and time</li>
      <li>Reframes particles as temporal processes</li>
      <li>Explains quantum/classical behavior as coherence regimes</li>
      <li>Avoids vacuum-energy catastrophes</li>
      <li>Accounts for cosmic structure as phase-coherent patterning</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      This is not reinterpretation — it is <strong>structural consolidation</strong>.
